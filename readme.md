Got a cool new car? Get too much video to filter through in one life time?

SideCar Video is a project where you keep your videos, and bring the software to your data.

Sidecar will sort through your data by taggin it for things of interest. (faces, animals, other close cars) and show you the most 'interesting' video first. so that you can more quickly find the clips of "who unplugged your car"? what was the licence plate of who car who dinged you? Who dumped salmon chunks all over the hood pf your car, (not very funny Bryan, but I suspect I will have the last laugh here)

SideCar Video respects your privacy. It sends none of yoru videos to any random place on the web. Thus it even works in "airplane mode." 

You can help SideCar get better over time by giving us examples of where the system messes up, but all of that is well documented and works on an opt-in basis.
